1. Set your config in file: ./config_db.php

2. Set three database on your server:
 ./react_task_1_clients.sql; 
 ./react_task_1_tasks.sql; 
 ./react_task_1_users.sql

3. Set path (in ...src\api\api.js and ...\src\redux\commonReducer.js) to your store DIR-corePHP; in my case, in my case application hosting and database hosting are different hosting.
